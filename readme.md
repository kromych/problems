## Solutions to selected problems

1. [Coins:](src/coins.cpp)
```
    Given a set of coin values { c_1 , c_2 , ... , c_k }
    and a target sum of money n, form the sum n 
    using as few coins as possible.
```
```
$\forall$
```

2. [Maximum sum:](src/array-max-sum-non-conseq.cpp)
```
    Find the maximum sum of non-consecutive (non-adjacent)
    array items.
```
3. [Number of ways to form a number](src/array-sum-num-of-ways.cpp)
```
    Given 3 numbers {1, 3, 5}, tell the total number of ways 
    to form a number N using the sum of the given three numbers.
    Repetitions and different arrangements are allowed.
```
4. [Longest Increasing Subsequence](src/array-lis.cpp)
```
    The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find the length of the 
    longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence 
    are sorted in increasing order.
```
5. [Coins change](src/coins-2.cpp)
```
    Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, and we have infinite supply of each
    of S = {S1, S2, ... , Sm} valued coins, how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins
    does not matter.

    For example, for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, there are four solutions: {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}.
    So output should be 4.

    For N = 10 and S = {2, 5, 3, 6}, there are five solutions: {2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5}
    and {5,5}.
    So the output should be 5.
```
6. [Coins change, using BFS](src/coins-bfs.cpp)
```
    Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, and we have infinite supply of each
    of S = {S1, S2, ... , Sm} valued coins, how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins
    does not matter.

    For example, for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, there are four solutions: {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}.
    So output should be 4.

    For N = 10 and S = {2, 5, 3, 6}, there are five solutions: {2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5}
    and {5,5}.
    So the output should be 5.
```
7. [Longest Common Subsequence](src/lcs.cpp)
```
    Given two sequences, find the length of longest subsequence present in both of them.
```
8. [Edit Distance](src/edit.cpp)
```
    Given two strings, find the minimum number of operations to turn one string into the other one.
    Operations may be: insert a symbol, remove a symbol, replace a symbol. All operations are of equal cost.
```
9. [Binary Knapsack](src/knapsack-binary.cpp)
```
    Put items of maximum total value in a knapsack of capacity W.
```
10. [Maximum subarray (Kadane's Alogorithm)](src/kadane.cpp)
```
    In an array, find a subarray whose items are of the maximum sum.
```
