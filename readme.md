## Solutions to selected problems

1. [Coins:](src/coins.cpp)
```
    Given a set of coin values { c_1 , c_2 , ... , c_k }
    and a target sum of money n, form the sum n 
    using as few coins as possible.
```
2. [Maximum sum:](src/array-max-sum-non-conseq.cpp)
```
    Find the maximum sum of non-consecutive (non-adjacent)
    array items.
```
3. [Number of ways to form a number](src/array-sum-num-of-ways.cpp)
```
    Given 3 numbers {1, 3, 5}, tell the total number of ways 
    to form a number N using the sum of the given three numbers.
    Repetitions and different arrangements are allowed.
```
4. [Longest Increasing Subsequence](src/array-lis.cpp)
```
    The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find the length of the 
    longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence 
    are sorted in increasing order.
```
5. [Coins change](src/coins-2.cpp)
```
    Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, and we have infinite supply of each
    of S = {S1, S2, ... , Sm} valued coins, how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins
    does not matter.

    For example, for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, there are four solutions: {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}.
    So output should be 4.

    For N = 10 and S = {2, 5, 3, 6}, there are five solutions: {2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5}
    and {5,5}.
    So the output should be 5.
```
6. [Coins change, using BFS](src/coins-bfs.cpp)
```
    Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, and we have infinite supply of each
    of S = {S1, S2, ... , Sm} valued coins, how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins
    does not matter.

    For example, for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, there are four solutions: {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}.
    So output should be 4.

    For N = 10 and S = {2, 5, 3, 6}, there are five solutions: {2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5}
    and {5,5}.
    So the output should be 5.
